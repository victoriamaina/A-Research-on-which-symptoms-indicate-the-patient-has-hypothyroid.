# A-Research-on-which-symptoms-indicate-the-patient-has-hypothyroid.

Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain crucial hormones.

Nairobi hospital wishes to know whether a patient's symptoms indicate the patient has hypothyroid.

Defining the Question The research problem is to study  build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

b) Defining the Metric for Success This project will be successful when: 1)We Identify the most crucial independent variables that affect Hypothyroidism.
2)The model achieves atleast 80% accuracy

c) Understanding the context

d)Experimental Design

The project was undertaken using the following design Datasets(hypothyroid nairobi hospital dataset)

Cleaning datasets

Performing EDA

Feature Engineering

Hyperparemeter tuning

Decision Trees

Support Vector Machine

Challenging the solution

Conclusion
